I’m proud to share that on **27th September 2025**, I officially **graduated from United States International University–Africa (USIU–Africa)** in Nairobi, Kenya, with a **Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Technology**, concentrating in **Software Engineering**.  

I graduated with **_Magna Cum Laude_ honors** 🏅 and was listed on the **Dean’s List every semester** throughout my studies (2021–2025).  

This milestone reflects years of dedication, growth, and support from mentors, peers, and my family. I’m excited for the journey ahead as I continue to build impactful solutions in the tech space.
