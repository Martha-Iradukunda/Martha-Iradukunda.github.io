Martha: I can’t believe it’s finally here — September 27, 2025. The day I graduated with **Magna Cum Laude honors** from **United States International University–Africa**!

Friend: Wow, that’s incredible! What was your degree again?

Martha: **Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Technology**, with a concentration in **Software Engineering**. Four years of hard work, growth, and so many late nights.

Friend: I remember those Andela bootcamps you told me about. And the KCB internship — you were designing UIs like a pro.

Martha: Exactly. From UI/UX prototyping at **KCB Bank**, to full-stack development during my **Andela Apprenticeship**, to founding community tech initiatives in Rwanda… it’s been a meaningful journey.

Friend: And you made the Dean’s List every semester, right?

Martha: Every single one. 📚 Consistency, resilience, and a love for building technology that solves real problems.

Friend: So what’s next?

Martha: I’m excited to keep learning, collaborate with forward-thinking teams, and create scalable digital solutions that make a difference. 🚀

Friend: You’ve earned it. Congratulations, Martha!

Martha: Thank you 🙏 — this is just the beginning.
