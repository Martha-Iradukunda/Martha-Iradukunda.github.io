Check out my **GitHub Portfolio**, where I showcase some of the projects I’ve worked on — from full-stack web applications developed during my Andela apprenticeship to UI/UX prototypes and backend integrations built during my internship at KCB Bank Kenya.

> Each project reflects my passion for building impactful, user-centered solutions that address real community needs.
